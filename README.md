COMPARISION OF PERFORMANCE OF SOME MACHINE LEARNING MODELS FOR HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION

In this project, we will compare some of the well-known machine learning models like
Multiple Linear regression, Ridge regression, Lasso, XGBoost, SVM(Support Vector Machine),
ANN(Artificial Neural Network) after applying them on a dataset imported from
the kaggle competition ”House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques”. Here, our aim
is to find the best model that will fit our problem (predicting the price of a house). We
begin by EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), where we try to visualize various parameters
by analyzing the datasets and summarizing their main characteristics. It helps us to get an
initial impression of the data we have before making any assumptions. In fact, It can help
identify obvious errors, as well as better understand patterns within the data, detect outliers
or anomalous events, find interesting relations among the variables. Then, we prepare the
data for modelling, by cleaning the data, processing the missing data, selecting the relevant
variables, deducing some features, run statistical tests, defining the regression models and
finally choosing the best price prediction model for the test set. For comparison between
models we will use four common evaluation metrics i.e, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean
Squared Error (MSE), RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), R2 Square.
